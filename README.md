# Web-Based-Cart-System
This project is a fully functional web-based shopping cart system developed using HTML and CSS for the front-end and Java for the back-end logic. It simulates an e-commerce experience, allowing users to browse through a list of products, add or remove items to/from their cart, update item quantities, and view the total cost dynamically.

The front-end interface was created with HTML for structuring the content and CSS for styling and layout design. The layout is intuitive and responsive, providing users with a seamless shopping experience. Basic user actions like adding products, adjusting quantities, and removing items are clearly accessible and easy to use.

The back-end is implemented using Java, which handles the core business logic such as session management, item tracking, and cart operations. It ensures data integrity and updates the cart contents in real time. The use of Java enhances the security and scalability of the application, making it adaptable for larger, database-integrated systems in the future.

The system is modular and follows good coding practices for ease of maintenance and potential future upgrades. It is suitable for educational purposes as well as a base model for more complex online retail platforms. Features like total price calculation, stock checks, and simple input validation have also been incorporated.

Overall, this project demonstrates fundamental skills in web development, object-oriented programming, and user interface design, showcasing the ability to integrate front-end and back-end technologies effectively.
